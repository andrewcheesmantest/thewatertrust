vars to remove:
- nitrates
- nitrites
- arsenic

operational report:

- discrepancies between reports - site-level flags?
- social side: health outcomes, how people use the well (safe water chain)
- build in safe water chain indicators
- logic definitions for operational report - next step; look for WP/WQ/HH conflicts

					2. functionality - most recent
					3. reliability within past year
